<p>Ok, here is this bad boy.&nbsp; This is the <a href="http://www.plansnow.com/snrout.html" target="_blank">Complete
Router Table</a> plans came from <a href="http://www.plansnow.com" target="_blank">PlansNOW.com</a>.&nbsp;
These plans were first published in <a href="http://www.shopnotes.com" target="_blank">ShopNotes</a>
#1.&nbsp; I picked this table because it looked simple enough for me to build,
sturdy, yet I can move it around as need be in my Garage Shop.&nbsp; I decided
to forgo the fence in those plans and instead built the Router Table Fence from
ShopNotes #69.&nbsp; In just materials, it looks like I have about $180.00 in
this table.&nbsp; This doesn't count needing to buy some router bits, drill
bits, a new hole saw, etc.&nbsp; I got nickel and dimed to death on fasteners of
various kinds, but again, I'm just starting out, so that is to be expected I
guess.&nbsp; What really shocked me was the price of the plastic knobs for all
the fixtures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="pictures/rt1.jpg" align="left" width="349" height="424">Here is the completed base
and top before I cut the insert out.&nbsp; This is one sturdy table.&nbsp; The
top is composed of a piece of birch plywood (I just used the stuff from <a href="http://www.homedepot.com" target="_blank">Home
Depot</a>, not Baltic Birch) laminated to two pieces of 1/4&quot; Hardboard,
then with hardwood edges added to that.&nbsp; I happened to have used a piece of
clear pine I had around.&nbsp; It looks nice enough now, but I know it probably
will get nicked up bad.&nbsp; That is ok, as we proceed you will see that I'll
remake the table top at some point in time.&nbsp; Anyhow, then I added laminate
to both sides of the top.&nbsp; Now we are ready to cut up this nice table top
we just got done making.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="pictures/rt3.jpg" align="right" width="433" height="176">This is the section I cut out for the insert so you can see a cross-section
of what the table top looks like.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, the plans said to use double-sided tape to hold down guide strips to
route out the insert lip.&nbsp; However, when I purchased said tape, I got what
was available at the local Sears Hardware.&nbsp; This is not good stuff, as the
guild boards slipped several times as I was attempting this as you can see here:</p>
<p><img border="0" src="pictures/rt4.jpg" width="510" height="227"><img border="0" src="pictures/rt5.jpg" width="554" height="280"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img border="0" src="pictures/rt6.jpg" align="left" width="437" height="180">My plan was to just make a bigger insert plate to cover up my gouging,
however when I was routing the grooves for my T-Track, I had another snafu.</p>
<p>Several things happened here.&nbsp; One, even with quick clamps on my guide
board, it still moved over my laminated table.&nbsp; Second, my pattern bit at
the time was a Viper bit that you buy at Home Depot.&nbsp; I haven't tried it
since, but I think cutting through all the hardboard dulled it some, as it did a
lot of grabbing as you can see in the picture to the left.&nbsp; The third
problem was that the set screw to the stop collar on the pattern bit fell
out.&nbsp; After really goobering up this groove is when I discovered
that.&nbsp; Luckily (or unluckily for my wallet) I have discovered I live just
about 10 miles south of <a href="http://www.eagle-america.com" target="_blank">Eagle America</a>
A.K.A. <a href="http://www.pricecutter.com" target="_blank">PriceCutter.com</a>.&nbsp; They
happen to run a little outlet store up there and are very helpful.&nbsp; All I
have to do is walk in with a list of catalog numbers, they enter it in and in a
few minutes they bring up my order.&nbsp; They also have several things on
display, but if you know what you want, it is easier to just give them the
catalog numbers.</p>
<p>I purchased my T-Track from Eagle America too, they claim it is
pre-counter-sunk to accept #6 Flat Head wood screws.&nbsp; Bullshit, the counter-sink
just isn't deep enough to not have your screw head stick up and the track is so
narrow that you cannot get a counter sink bit down in there to make it
deeper.&nbsp; Luckily the track fits pretty dang snug in a 3/4&quot; routed
dado.&nbsp; I did use some #4 FH screws to give it a little extra hold down
though.</p>
<p>Here is the finished table:</p>
