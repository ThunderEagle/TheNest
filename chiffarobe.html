  <p>First, please excuse the mess.  My little girl isn't too messy, but her room is constantly assulted by her <i>energetic</i> little brother.  Anyhow,
  this was built to replace a similar item we had that came from a Wal-mart but was made of particle board.  It began to fall apart, and I basically recreated
  it out of plywood.  She of course wanted it pink and purple, and that is what she got.  My wife painted the flower templates on it.  This was my first attempt
  at drawers.  I didn't do anything fancy, just 3/4" birch plywood butt jointed with glue and drywall screws.  Drawer slides and then another piece of 3/4" birch ply as
  a face with iron on edge-banding.  I learned a good bit on this project.  Good thing too, because now I'm building one for my son, but with some changes.  First a picture with
  the doors open.</p>

  <h2 align="center">Boy's Chiffarobe</h2>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" src="./pictures/chiffarobe1.jpg"></p>
  <p>Obviously not completed yet.  This one I made shorter, but longer.  I also eliminated the one compartment with a door and opted for a 4th drawer.</p>
  <p>The drawer construction is a little different now as well.  Instead of 3/4" Birch ply, I used 1/2" Oak plywood.  No real reason for the Oak except that
  when I went to Home Depot to purchase it, their 1/2 Oak was in MUCH better shape than their 1/2" birch, and it cost the same amount.  Also, the first drawers had
  1/4" hardboard as their bottoms, these use 1/4 Luan.  The construction also used rabbets and brads instead of butt joints and drywall screws.  I really like my
  little BN125A PC nailer.  I still have to cut and install the drawer faces that will be out of 3/4" birch, but this time instead of iron on edge banding, I will
  cuts strips of poplar to edge band with.</p>
  <p>Another difference is on the first one, the plywood pieces came to the ground and then I added in a kickplate with the bottom of the cabinet dadoed in.  This one is a plywood box
  with mitred corners (biscuits as well) and a box of 1x4 poplar as the base.  I need to cut and install the door for the right side, as well as cut a piece of 
  1/4 Luan that I will tack to the back with my brad nailer.  The first chiffarobe has a groove cut with 1/4" hardboard in it for the back.  Both of the door areas
  have shelf pin holes drilled in them for some adjustable shelving.  My daughters are made out of 1/2" MDF, and I'll probably use MDF for my son's as well.
  </p>
  <p>Expected color scheme will be Blue, Red, Green, Orange.   Don't freak out too much, we recently did his room in a 
  <a href="http://disney.go.com/vault/archives/characters/buzz/buzz.html" target="_blank">Buzz Lightyear</a> motif.  We gave it the whole 
  "<a href="http://tlc.discovery.com/fansites/tradingspaces/tradingspaces.html" target="_blank">Trading Spaces</a>"
  treatment with verticle stripes of varing widths on blue walls.  It actually came out pretty cool.
  </p>
  
  <p>This is now complete:<br>

  <p>It ended up coming out much tamer, as he ended up asking for it to be "All dark blue", he even freaked at the red knobs.</p>
