<h2 align="center">Router Table Fence</h2>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="pictures/routerfence1.jpg" width="533" height="331"></p>
<p>This is the Router Table Fence featured in 
<a href="http://www.shopnotes.com/main/sn69-toc.html" target="_blank">ShopNotes #69</a>. 
The plans called for Baltic Birch, however, I used normal
birch plywood for mine.&nbsp; The most difficult aspects of my version of this
fence was making some of the relief cuts needed for the piece of Aluminum
Angle.&nbsp; Other than that, you really just need to make sure you have
everything flush when you glue up the back portion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img border="0" src="pictures/routerfence3.jpg" align="right" width="185" height="387">I
made a couple of modifications.&nbsp; The first was to add a 5th board to the
smaller portion of the back to accommodate the dust port attachment.&nbsp; The
plans had directions to make a dust port, however it involved some miter cuts,
one of which they showed on a ban saw, which I do not own one of.&nbsp; It also
really requires a drill press to properly make the hole, and I didn't think
using a hand held drill with a hole saw was going to get the job done.&nbsp; I
also added the knobs and the 1/4&quot; Hex bolts to the side instead of using
C-Clamps to hold it in place.&nbsp; While I squared the lines for my T-Track to
the front T-Track, there is still about a 1/16&quot; variation from the back of
the table to the top of the T-Track, so I used a 5/16&quot; drill bit to make
the holes for my 1/4&quot; bolts to give them enough movement to slide the fence
easily from front to back.&nbsp; The plans also called for a 3&quot; hole for
the bit relief, however the biggest hole saw I could purchase for the arbor I
already had (Craftsman kit) was 2 1/2&quot;.&nbsp; I have no raised panel bits,
so I do not think this will be an issue.&nbsp; If I were to remake this fence, I
would make the bottom two layers of birch plywood wider than they currently are
as the fence is a little top heavy since I added the extra layer and made my
split fences taller accordingly.&nbsp; This brought my height up to 5&quot; from
the 4 1/2&quot; called for in the plans.</p>

The <a href="http://www.eagle-america.com/html/catalog/productGroup.asp?id=333670" target="_blank">Bit
Guard</a> I purchased from <a href="http://www.eagle-america.com" target="_blank">Eagle-America</a>,&nbsp;
I would like to add the <a href="http://www.eagle-america.com/html/catalog/productGroup.asp?id=333671" target="_blank">Freehand
Guard</a> one day as well.&nbsp; The T-Track is just held in with friction as
being only 3/4&quot; Plywood and the groove being 3/8&quot; deep, there isn't
much room for a screw.&nbsp; If it ever becomes and issue I may use Contact
Cement or some other form of Liquid Nails to affix them permanently, but I would
rather have the option of pulling them out.&nbsp; As you look at the top
picture, the fence laying on the table is my jointer face.&nbsp; It is made just
like the other two, but there is no T-Track and there is a second layer of
laminate added to the front.&nbsp; The top and sides of the fences have a 45
degree 1/16&quot; chamfer and the bottoms are trimmed flush.&nbsp; I still need
to make 45 degree cuts to the inside edges of the fences to allow for bit
clearance, but I have just been putting off setting up my Table Saw to do that
(no mitre saw yet).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some views of the aluminum angle that the sliding faces run
on.&nbsp; The cut for the angle could have been a little better, however the way
it is gives me some clearance if my screws are not completely flush.</p>
