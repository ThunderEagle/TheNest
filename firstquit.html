<b><br><br>Comments:</b><SPAN class=comments>Well, I sit here after having just put 
in a big dip of Skoal. But, the reason I am here, is I do want to quit, I just 
need to do it. The biggest reason right now, is because I have two small 
children. One almost 3, the other 9 months. I quit for a while when my olders 
(daughter) was born. I was using Golden Eagle Herbal chew, and it was working 
out ok. Then there was a day where I was out, and my next shipment had not yet 
arrived (no where to buy it around where I live, I went around checking a bit). 
But, that was only one can, and then I went back to the herbal stuff. Well, that 
was my downfall. I then got it in my head that every once in a while was fine. I 
kept a tin in my truck for when I worked in the yard on the weekends. That 
lasted about 3 weeks before I was full force back onto this shit! Now, my 9 
month old is a boy, and I really don't want him to pick up on this habbit. The 
money I am wasting is just horrible on this stuff! I used to always need on in 
the car/truck, that really isn't an issue anymore. Right now for me, the shower 
is another times I really want one, I think that is a hold over habbit from 
dipping while I was still a teenager, but my biggest problem is when I am in 
front of a computer. You see, I'm a programmer, so I sit in front of one for at 
least 8 hours a day, and for the most part, this is my entertainment source as 
well. So, I sit in front of it for a few hours at home each night as well. I 
have this thought that I cannot sit still and concentrate without a dip in. I 
did try a half hearted attempt to quit when my son was born. I had ordered some 
of the Smokey Mountain stuff, but didn't quite find that as appealing as the 
Golden Eagle, however, I think they come from the same place, I was probably 
just not as commited as I was the previous time. I don't know if I am a heavy 
user or not. I think I'm a little less than a tin a day user. Like 2 tins every 
3 days. My biggest problem, just like I am sure with the rest of you, even 
though I hate the money it costs, and the dangers it presents to my health, I 
just flat out freaking enjoy dipping!!! That fact right there disgusts me, but 
it is just so good! Well, I have several web pages open right now, looking for 
some techniques to quit, I'm off to read those, and the rest of this site. I'm 
not quitting right now, but I'm hoping to soon, it has to be done, and I'm 
trying to prepare myself for it. Good luck to everyone else, and you cannot let 
yourself have another dip, it will just open the dam, I have already learned 
that one the hard way. Oh, if you have read this far, anyone know of 
other/better substitues than Smokey Mountain or Golden Eagle? </SPAN>

<b><br><br>Comments:</b><SPAN class=comments>Well, I must say that this forum is 
giving me a lot of confidance to quit again. I'm ready this time, and I think 
you guys may be that extra push that I need to do it. I put in my order for some 
nicotine free stuff today, and I think I will start next week. I know for a fact 
that I will need a substitue to get throught this, it is such a natural part of 
my day that there is no way for me not to put something in my lip. Hopefully I 
will lose my dependance on that as well. My Dad quit smoking several years ago, 
and in talking with him, he says that he *still* wants to smoke another one, but 
he just doesn't. I guess not doing it can be as much of a habbit as doing it. 
Thanks to those who have emailed me their support. When I make the switch, I'll 
be sure to add in my daily trials and tribulations. :)</SPAN>

<b><br><br>Comments:</b><SPAN class=comments>Well, Day 2 I guess. I was a bit busy 
to post yesterday, as we had a new furance installed in the house. What a day to 
quit right? :) 

Anyhow, things are not too bad, however I am using 
Bacc-off to get me through and I have hit that stuff harder than I hit Skoal. As 
far as irritation, my lip actually feels like it is healing some using the 
substitute.

I know that some don't think the substitutes are a good idea, 
but I know from experience that without one, I will last all of about 3 hours 
without a dip. Almost 44 hours now without a dip of Skoal. So far so good. Now 
we just have to see if the dependance on the Bacc-off will drop, and if I will 
be able to concentrate at work tomorrow. 

Good Luck Everyone!</SPAN>

<b><br><br>Comments:</b><SPAN class=comments>Well, may have spoke a bit too soon 
about it being a good day. Got a bit cranky when the wife got home from work, 
and by late evening I was a little short with my Daughter, and I don't know if 
it was because she pushed me that far, or if it just didn't take all that much 
pushing. 

Oh, can anyone tell me why I am so damn thirsty now??? I have 
been sucking down pop and water all day long. 

Now, to get through a day 
of work. Tomorrow is the test. :)</SPAN>
